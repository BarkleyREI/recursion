Barkley's Fractal theme based on Mandelbrot.

## Theme settings

This theme is based on Mandelbrot, so all settings used for that theme are valid here as well.

There are a few new settings that only apply to this theme:

- `logo`: Path to client logo. Will appear above documentation pages.
- `devpanels`: Tabs that appear below components but only when running a server. Uses the same options as `panels`.
